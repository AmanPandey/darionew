        Nature has kept infinite possibilities in her particle, which we cannot see but definitely feel. Then whether 
        it is a simple looking seed, water, gem or stone. Just as a seed engulfs fertile soil and gives life form to 
        its existence, in the same way a simple stone, after being sculpted into an idol, becomes a reflection of the 
        divine powers by consecration. Ordinary water, after mixing a few drops of Ganges water, becomes like nectar. 
        Many examples of shaktipat have also been presented in the Vedic structures, as well as they have been accepted 
        scientifically. Japanese scientist Masaru Emoto has mentioned this in many of his books. It has been completely 
        proved by bhatik shastra and chemistry that water has the ability to preserve information, just as water can store 
        any information or mantra in itself for 4 to 5 hours. Similar gems which we know by many names like topaz, emerald, 
        sapphire, ruby ​​etc., are capable of retaining any information inside them for life. In astrological mode, it is 
        called anointing. Luck can be made strong by securing mantras in gems. To achieve success by connecting the infinite 
        stream of these abilities with our destiny, we should wear the energized ring, which in common language is called ring charging.
